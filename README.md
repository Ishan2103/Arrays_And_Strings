# Arrays_And_Strings
# ðŸ§ª C++ Experiment 4  
## Arrays & Strings in C++

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Aim

To understand and implement operations on arrays and strings in C++:

- Store, access, and manipulate data using arrays  
- Use built-in and manual methods to work with strings  

---

### ðŸ§  Learning Objectives

âœ… Understand the structure and behavior of arrays and strings  
âœ… Perform search, aggregation, and comparison tasks on arrays  
âœ… Perform basic string operations: concatenation, reversal, and palindrome detection  
âœ… Learn different initialization and iteration techniques for arrays and strings

### ðŸ“š Theory

#### ðŸ”¹ Arrays in C++

An **array** is a collection of variables of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations. Arrays allow indexed access to individual elements.

- **Declaration:** `int arr[5];`  
- **Initialization:** `int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};`  
- **Access:** `arr[2]` refers to the 3rd element  

ðŸ“Œ **Common Operations:**  
- Traversal using loops  
- Searching for an element  
- Summing elements  
- Finding min/max  

#### ðŸ”¹ Strings in C++

A **string** is a sequence of characters. In C++, strings can be managed as:

- **Character Arrays:** `char str[10] = "Hello";`  
- **String Class (STL):** `string s = "Hello";`

ðŸ“Œ **Common Operations:**  
- Concatenation: `str1 + str2`  
- Length: `str.length()`  
- Reversal: `reverse(str.begin(), str.end());`  
- Palindrome check: Compare string to its reverse

### ðŸ›  Tools Used

- **Programming Language:** C++  
- **Compiler:** g++ (GNU Compiler Collection)  
- **Editor/IDE:** Visual Studio Code  
- **Operating System:** Windows 10

### ðŸ§¾ Program Summary

#### ðŸ“Œ Array Programs

1. **Print an Array**  
   âž¤ Loop through the array and print each element.

2. **Find Specific Number in Array**  
   âž¤ Input a number and check its presence in the array.

3. **Sum & Average of Elements**  
   âž¤ Use a loop to accumulate the sum and compute the average.

4. **Find Minimum & Maximum**  
   âž¤ Use comparison logic while traversing to find min and max values.

#### ðŸ“Œ String Programs

5. **Different Ways to Initialize a String**  
   âž¤ Show initialization using character arrays and `string` class.

6. **Concatenation of Strings**  
   âž¤ Join two strings using `+` or `append()`.

7. **Print String in Reverse**  
   âž¤ Use a loop or STL `reverse()` function to print in reverse.

8. **Check for Palindrome**  
   âž¤ Compare the string with its reverse to determine if itâ€™s a palindrome.

### âœ… Conclusion

This experiment enhanced understanding of how arrays and strings function in C++. Students learned to perform key operations such as searching, comparing, summing, and reversing both arrays and strings â€” all crucial for handling structured data efficiently in C++.
